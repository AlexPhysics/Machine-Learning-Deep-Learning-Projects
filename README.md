# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Projects

Welcome to this introduction of Deep Learning / Machine Learning with Python. This lab sessions present my practical work along with some theory.

We will mainly touch : 
1. Nerual Networks (NN)
2. Handwritten digit Classification
3. Convolutional Neural Networks, uses in Computer Vision.
4. Detection of diseases in medical images.
5. Recurrent Neural Networks.
6. Examples in Natural Language processing.

# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Projects

I warmly welcome you to my Deep Learning / Machine Learning projects in Python. The present sessions focus mainly on applications of ML/DL along with some theory.

We will mainly touch : 
1. Nerual Networks (NN)
2. Handwritten digit Classification
3. Convolutional Neural Networks, uses in Computer Vision.
4. Detection of diseases in medical images.
5. Recurrent Neural Networks.
6. Examples in Natural Language processing.
